1. a list of moves made
2. copy and then add a possible move to the list of moves
3. use the function to test if the move is valid / see if makeMove function throws an exception
4. see if Pete's position is hte mountaintop position
5. we have to be worried about cycles. We can avoid them by implementing a move set to make sure we aren't making the same moves over and over
